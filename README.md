# DeepLearningPlayground

Getting your hands on the right kind of data to test your neural nets can be tricky. This project hopes to address that issue.

Note: artificial data is rarely a decent replacement for real data but then if your ANN can't find a signal in deliberately manufactured data, it's unlikely to find it in real data. 

My experiments with deep learning (using mainly dl4j).
